# The New Web
This is my 6th HTML/CSS project. It is a clone The New Web's [homepage](https://thenextweb.com/#.tnw_zzwBKA4c).
To see the exact version go to this [web archive](http://web.archive.org/), and look for the date that is closest to July 19th, 2017.

The purpose of this project was to work on my responsive design skills.
Along the way I also learned a ton about flex boxes(10/10) and used all the other skills I have been learning. Due to the purpose being responsive practice not all links have hover modes and not all the images have inlaid captions. After getting the other stuff done, I didn't see the point. 

This project is part of [TheOdinProject's](http://www.theodinproject.com) HTML/CSS track.
The project itself can be seen [here](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/html5-and-css3/lessons/building-with-responsive-design)!
